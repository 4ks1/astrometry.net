* = properly packaged / done

Libraries
=========
*libkd - wrapper for libkd C library + matching for spherical coordinates
*anresample - resampling functions implemented in C/Python
astrometry/blind - wrapper for astrometry/blind C library + other Python utilities (?)
astrometry/catalogs - complementary Python modules (?) for astrometry/catalogs C library
astrometry/files - wrapper (util.i) for astrometry/{utils,files,blind} ?? + other Python utilities (?)
astrometry/plotstuff - wrapper for astrometry/plotstuff C library (BUT: depends on blind's coadd.h!!)
astrometry/utils - Python helpers for other packages (BUT: depends on util.i)

-> util.i should be split up to get dependencies right

Random files

Partially they depend on the libraries above.
